# Polkadot JAM: Innovative Custom Solutions and Applications

## Introduction to Polkadot JAM

Polkadot JAM (Join-Accumulate Machine) represents a revolutionary protocol designed to succeed the Polkadot relay chain. It introduces a more flexible, scalable, and efficient architecture for blockchain development with several groundbreaking components and features.

JAM's name derives from CoreJAM (Collect-Refine-Join-Accumulate), which outlines its computation model. The protocol aims to provide a decentralized hybrid system with smart-contract functionality built around a secure and scalable in-core/on-chain dualism.

## Core Components of JAM

### 1. CoreJAM Computation Model

- **Refine**: The off-chain processing stage that handles large datasets (up to 15MB per 6-second slot)
- **Accumulate**: The on-chain integration stage that processes results from Refine (limited to 90kB output)
- **OnTransfer**: Handles communication and fund transfers between services

### 2. Services

Services in JAM are similar to smart contracts but more powerful. They encapsulate:
- Code
- Balance
- State

Each service has three entry points:
- `fn refine()`: For in-core execution (stateless)
- `fn accumulate()`: For on-chain execution (stateful)
- `fn onTransfer()`: For handling incoming transfers from other services

### 3. Polkadot Virtual Machine (PVM)

- Based on the RISC-V instruction set architecture
- More efficient than WebAssembly for blockchain operations
- Supports continuations for better parallelization
- Easier to transpile into common hardware formats (x86, x64, ARM)
- Well-supported by tooling like LLVM

### 4. SAFROLE

- A SNARK-based block production algorithm
- Simplified version of the SASSAFRAS algorithm
- Uses tickets as anonymous entries into the block production mechanism

### 5. Networking

- Uses the QUIC protocol for direct point-to-point connections
- Enables persistent connections between all validators
- Uses grid-diffusal for distributing data that isn't point-to-point

## Key Innovations in JAM

1. **Transactionless Design**: No traditional transactions; uses work packages and work items instead
2. **Pipelining**: More efficient block processing by using prior state root in headers
3. **Permissionless Execution**: Anyone can deploy services without governance approval
4. **Metered Execution**: Reduces need for benchmarking
5. **Full XCMP Support**: Enhanced cross-chain message passing
6. **Accords**: Multi-instance, multi-sharded smart contracts for cross-chain interactions
